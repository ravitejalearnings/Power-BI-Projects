# Festival Season Sales/Promotions Analysis

## Project Overview
XYZ, an FMCG retail giant in India, conducted large-scale promotions on branded products during two major festivals: Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. The Sales Director wants to evaluate the success of these promotions to make informed decisions for future campaigns. This analysis focuses on identifying high-performing promotions and uncovering opportunities to optimize future sales strategies across regions.

## Goals & Deliverables
The primary deliverable is an interactive and visually compelling Power BI Dashboard that presents meaningful insights derived from the promotional data. This dashboard will enable stakeholders to:
- Track promotion performance across various metrics.
- Identify new market opportunities.
- Optimize future sales strategies by understanding past promotional effectiveness.

## Dashboard Insights
The Power BI dashboard provides comparative insights across several key metrics and dimensions:
- **Revenue**: Compare revenue before and after the promotional periods.
- **Volume**: Assess sales volume changes before and after promotions.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Analyze changes in AOV due to promotions.
- **ROI (Return on Investment)**: Measure the effectiveness of promotions in driving sales relative to investment.

## Key Metrics Covered
1. **Revenue**: Revenue Before Promo vs. Revenue After Promo.
2. **Volumes**: Volume Before Promo vs. Volume After Promo.
3. **Average Order Value (AOV)**: AOV Before Promo vs. AOV After Promo.
4. **ROI**: Return on Investment for promotional campaigns.

## Insights & Dimensions
To provide granular insights, the dashboard breaks down data across various dimensions:
- **Top Cities vs. Others**: Insights into city-level performance, comparing top cities to others.
- **Top Categories vs. Others**: Identify high-performing product categories.
- **Pareto Analysis**: Conducted on cities, products, and categories to highlight the top contributors to revenue and volume.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and aggregated data to support effective visualization.
- **Dashboard Design**: Interactive visuals and filters to enable dynamic exploration of data.
- **Insights & Analysis**: Analytical commentary provided within the dashboard to guide users in interpreting key trends.

## Future Improvements
Further enhancements could include:
- Customer-level analysis (if data becomes available).
- Additional segmentation by customer demographics.
